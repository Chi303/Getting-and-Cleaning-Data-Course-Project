Transformations performed on the data:
Load the activity and feature info
Load both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
Load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
Merge the two datasets
Convert the activity and subject columns into factors
Create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair
